# Abstract

## Aim and Motivation
Reducing the impact and spread of the coronavirus depends on public cooperation with state-imposed regulations. Cooperation is largely affected by the public’s perception of risk, where the magnitude of emotional responses plays an important role (Dyer & Kolic, 2020). This website aims to explore whether the perception of COVID-19 on twitter measured using sentiment analysis, is related to the reality of the pandemic measured by deaths and cases. By focusing on two case studies in the USA, we also aim to explore how the state imposed COVID-19 regulations affect the sentiment scores of tweets.

This project illustrates the potential value of social media as a real-time indicator of public risk perception. It could potentially guide the implementation of public communication and regulations to navigate potential future waves of COVID-19 pandemic and other public health crises.

## Approach
The study focuses on the sentiment analysis of tweets from the Twitter social media platform. The tweet-ID’s have been collected from an open source data set, and subsequently ‘hydrated’ to obtain the tweet text. Following pre-processing using our own python libraries, we have used Google Cloud Natural Language API to complete sentiment analysis.

Thus, we use Pearson’s correlation to examine the relationship between COVID-19 cases and deaths as the epidemiological indicator of the pandemic’s progression, with the sentiment score of tweets as an indicator of the public perception. Given the scope and time restrictions, we focus on data from the US in April 2020. Furthermore, selecting one Republican and one Democrat state based on the 2020 US election results as case studies, we examine the relationship between COVID-19 regulations and the sentiment score.
