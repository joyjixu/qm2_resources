As explained by Saunders et al. (2009) the methodology serves as the backbone of a research study. Limitations, more than just an independent consideration, are a complete part of that methodology that shapes the rest of a project. 
With our website came several challenges, that we classified under 4 categories.   
1)	Limitations due to the language of the datasets: 
Non-English tweets went through a translation process which is not always accurate. We also could only track English hashtags, further creating a bias towards that language. 
2)	Limitations due to the sentiment analysis process: 
Determining sentiment in tweets using existing libraries is limited by the fact that the majority of models do not have a satisfactory level of accuracy and recall (Zimbra, Abbasi, Zeng, and Chen, 2020). Moreover, we couldn’t take emojis into account as they are both too subjective and not supported by the library. 
3)	Limitations due to the format and quantity of tweets. 
The collection of such a vast amount of data through Twitter’s API is unfortunately limited as it only returned 1% of the total Twitter volume.  Furthermore, we missed some tweets as some hashtags were added or removed as data was being collected. Location is also not always recorded, and often inaccurate. 
4) Limitations regarding the way data were collected: 
Indeed, some states may not have collected there data on a daily basis, which can lead to irregularities. 
5) Data quality: Keywords tracked were removed or added throughout by the researcher who compiled the data set, as hashtags relating to COVID-19 became more or less relevant. This could potentially mean tweets that were relevant have been excluded. However, this is likely to have little effect as we are collecting data from one month where there were few changes in hashtags tracked. This would be a problem if we were analysing the tweets across the whole pandemic rather than a sample month, and we recommend that researchers using this dataset examine how many hashtags were added and removed from tracking over the period they are analysing
