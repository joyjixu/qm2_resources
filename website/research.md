#“What is the relationship between the sentiment score of tweets relating to the COVID-19 across states in the US and its severity (measured in this case by total deaths) in April 2020?”
Aim:
Understand whether, and the extent to which, the positivity/negativity of tweets is influenced by or independent of reality
Understand the relationship between total deaths and the sentiment scores of tweets
Understand the relationship between imposed COVID-19 state regulations and the sentiment scores of tweets

Objectives:
Pre-process and perform sentiment analysis on tweets collected from the dataset to obtain sentiment scores
Analyse the correlation between the daily change in the number of total COVID-19 deaths and sentiment scores of the tweets over the month of April
Analyse the relationship between the implementation of COVID-19 regulations by one state and the sentiment scores of tweets for that state

Why is it important?
Perception analysis of Tweets can inform us about public perception of COVID-19 & how reactions may be linked to, or differ from, regulations and the reality of cases and deaths (Chen, 2020)

Implications and value
1. Public policy for future  waves or other possible pandemics (Chen, 2020)
2. Implications for cyberpsychology - understanding how and whether the democratisation of digital technologies affects our perceptions of reality (Kurten, Beullens, 2020)
