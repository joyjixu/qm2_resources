This section is elaborates on the research and context.

Background & Context
The Covid-19 pandemic has caused global disruption, with many countries using state-imposed regulation to curtail the spread of the virus. With social distancing measures and public gatherings being wholly or partly prohibited on a global-scale, social media platforms have been increasingly used as a digital space to spread news and opinions about COVID-19 and the associated policies.
​
Twitter in particular is an important medium for collecting real-time information of public perception of risk as well as sentiment towards COVID-19.  To leverage this important resource, we must understand if there is a relationship between the public perception of the virus (measured through Sentiment Analysis of Tweets) and the reality of the virus (measured using cases, deaths and regulations).This research focuses on the USA as it has the largest number of Twitter Users in 2020 (68.7 million in October 2020) (Statistica, 2020). 

Introduction

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Twitter has continued to grow as a digital space where facts, news, and opinions about the pandemic have spread. This includes sources of public health information, where governments and health agencies communicate and disseminate information COVID-19 public health information (Hagg, 2018). 

Infodemiology is the science of understanding how information relating to health is shared via digital platforms with the objective of informing public policy and health. Infoveillance is a more specific area under this broad research which involves the “surveillance of public health-related concerns'' which are diffused across social media and the internet.This research has been particularly useful in understanding the public perception of diseases like the Ebola virus, Zika virus and ‘swine flu’ (H1N1 influenza), highlighting the potential uses of social media as a real-time data source of public risk perception (Eysenbach, 2020). 

Therefore, the aforementioned examples suggest there is potential to leverage social media data to understand public perception of COVID-19 and the relationship with the severity of the pandemic.
