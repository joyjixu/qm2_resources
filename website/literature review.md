This section is elaborates on the research and context.

Background & Context
The Covid-19 pandemic has caused global disruption, with many countries using state-imposed regulation to curtail the spread of the virus. With social distancing measures and public gatherings being wholly or partly prohibited on a global-scale, social media platforms have been increasingly used as a digital space to spread news and opinions about COVID-19 and the associated policies.
​
Twitter in particular is an important medium for collecting real-time information of public perception of risk as well as sentiment towards COVID-19.  To leverage this important resource, we must understand if there is a relationship between the public perception of the virus (measured through Sentiment Analysis of Tweets) and the reality of the virus (measured using cases, deaths and regulations).This research focuses on the USA as it has the largest number of Twitter Users in 2020 (68.7 million in October 2020) (Statistica, 2020). 

Introduction

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Twitter has continued to grow as a digital space where facts, news, and opinions about the pandemic have spread. This includes sources of public health information, where governments and health agencies communicate and disseminate information COVID-19 public health information (Hagg, 2018). 

Infodemiology is the science of understanding how information relating to health is shared via digital platforms with the objective of informing public policy and health. Infoveillance is a more specific area under this broad research which involves the “surveillance of public health-related concerns'' which are diffused across social media and the internet.This research has been particularly useful in understanding the public perception of diseases like the Ebola virus, Zika virus and ‘swine flu’ (H1N1 influenza), highlighting the potential uses of social media as a real-time data source of public risk perception (Eysenbach, 2020). 

Therefore, the aforementioned examples suggest there is potential to leverage social media data to understand public perception of COVID-19 and the relationship with the severity of the pandemic.

Sentiment Analysis

Perception of tweets is understood by analysing the language, emotion and tone. A useful tool to analyse large data sets of tweets is sentiment analysis/ This “attempts to determine the overall attitude (positive or negative) expressed within the text. Sentiment is represented by numerical score and magnitude values.” The score given is between -1 (extremely negative) and +1 (extremely positive) with 0 showing neutral sentiment. The magnitude is a numerical representation of the emotion in a text. A lower number indicates more factual tweets whereas a higher number indicates more emotional ones (D’Andrea, 2017). This is particularly useful for our study, to understand the type of content that is diffused across twitter. One aspect to be aware of is that unlike the sentiment score, the magnitude is affected by the length of the text, where longer tweets may have greater magnitudes. This is because magnitude is not normalised unlike sentiment scores.

Existing Literature

Given the evolving nature of the virus and disruption it has caused in academia, there are relatively few studies utilising sentiment analysis on tweets specifically for the COVID-19 pandemic.

One paper by Manguri, analysed tweets from one week in March on a global scale. Tweets were collected using two hashtags #COVID-19 and #Coronavirus. The findings indicated that nearly 60% of tweets were catagorised as “relaxed”,shown in figure 6, and 64% were objective. The research was useful at affirming the use of Twitter to disseminate facts and news. However, we found that very limited conclusions could be drawn as this was conducted over one week only. The visualisations employed were not as effective, as pie charts used to not provide a scale and it is difficult to compare the small changes in the angles.

Another graph shows how external factors, such as announcements of lockdowns in Italy and first reported deaths cause rises in the number of related tweets. This demonstrates how the reality of COVID-19 had some relationship with the sentiment. This study, however, did not execute a statistical score to understand the relationship between regulation and sentiment, so it is difficult to interpret whether this was a coincidental correlation, but not causation.

Our research
Informed by this research, we have identified shortfalls in the methodology and gaps in knowledge where new research would be valuable. Thus, we will examine the public perception (sentiment) towards COVID-19 compared with the reality of deaths and cases, and the imposition of state-enforced regulations. This focus fits into the wider academic discourse about the potential use of social media data to policy makers and the government in successfully curtailing the spread of the COVID-19 virus, as well as other potential and future public health threats. We have selected the US rather than looking at a global scale, like in Manguri’s research, as this will provide more relevant information that is contextualised. Given the time restrictions and scope of our research, we will focus on the month of April, as this is long enough to see the temporal distribution of data. April is also the month that coincided with the first peak of the virus, as well as significant regulations.
