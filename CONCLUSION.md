If we had further time, we would have used another analysis tool called Topic Modelling, which would allow us to identify recurring "topics" and hidden patterns amongst the large data set of tweets. 
More formally, it is a "technique that automatically creates topics based on patterns of occurrence of words in the documents that are analysed." (Jacobi, 2016). 
This could indicate why the sentiment score remained negative at times when restrictions were eased and deaths/ cases were falling. 
This is because other factors than deaths, cases and regulations could affect the public perception of COVID-19. 
For example, in April 2020 and there was widespread political uncertainty about how the election would be affected by COVID-19. Topic Modelling could reveal that "Trump" or "election" were recurring topics, potentially explaining why the sentiment score did not always reflect the severity of the pandemic."
