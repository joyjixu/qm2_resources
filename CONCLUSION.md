## CONCLUSION

In conclusion, our visualizations and analysis have shown that there is a relationship between the average COVID-19 tweet sentiment and COVID-19 deaths in the US. Thanks to the graphs from part 1 of the analysis, we now know that an increase in the number of deaths seems to correlate with a decrease in the average COVID-19 tweet sentiment in a statistically significant way.
 
However, no causal link between the number of cases and the average tweet sentiment has been established. Similarly, we couldn’t find any particular geographical trend within the US. It seems like individual states react to the national number of new deaths, not to the federal one, possibly since Twitter users are likely to follow and receive information from users outside their own state, which would influence their perceptions and sentiment. 

Finally, the case studies of Utah and Colorado confirmed our hypothesis of a correlation between the number of deaths and the average sentiment, providing a basis for further investigation. Furthermore, this comparison also showed, even at a regional level, the impact of the political leaning on the number of regulations and on the population reaction. We found that Republicans tend to react more strongly and negatively to COVID-19, and to impose fewer regulations than Democrats, although we couldn’t prove a relation between regulations and the average sentiment. However it is important to consider that we only looked at one Democrat and one Republican state, and more research is required to ensure the conclusions are generalizable.
