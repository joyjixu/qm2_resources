In conclusion, our visualizations and analysis have shown that there is a relationship between the average Covid-19 tweet sentiment and real-life Covid-19. Indeed, thanks to the graphs from part 1 of the analysis, we now know that an increase in the number of deaths causes a decrease of the average Covid-19 tweet sentiment. However, no causal link between the number of cases and the average tweet sentiment have been established. Similarly, we couldn’t find any particular geographical trend within the US. It seems like state reacts to the national number of new deaths, not to the federal one. Finally, the case study of Utah and Colorado confirmed our hypothesis of a causal relationship between the number of deaths and the average sentiment. Furthermore, this comparison also showed, even if it is at a regional level, the impact of the political color on the number of regulations and on the population reaction. We showed that republicans tend to react stronger to Covid-19, and to impose less regulation than democrats, although we couldn’t prove a relation between regulations and the average sentiment.
