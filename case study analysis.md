This case study will focus on analyzing two states from a different political color, and try to see how the regulations put in place by the government of the state 
affects the people’s sentiment expressed on twitter using graphs indicating the regulations linked with the sentimental analysis of tweets, and also the Hexbins
dataset obtained after anaylsing the sentiment expressed on twitter, the magnitude and the number of tweets.
We will focus on Utah and Colorado. Utah is a state that voted for the Republican party in 2020, while Colorado is a Democratic state.
We randomly selected one strongly democrat state and one strongly republican state, in order to determine if political views played a role in the relationship 
between twitter sentiment and Covid deaths.

Mainly, along the month of April 2020 the sentiment expressed on twitter by the inhabitants of the different states has decreased overall, becoming more negative 
than at the beginning of the month.This is due to the very significant increase in the number of deaths, April was a peak in the start of the spread of the 
coronavirus in the United States.

We can acknowledge rapidly the difference between the regulations by a politic and its impact. 
The first point we can notice directly is how the democratic party in Colorado has impose way more regulations than in Utah, 18 regulations in a month while only 8 
in the Republican state. The average sentiment is related to regulations, even more in the Democratic state of Colorado; as we can see, nearly each time a 
regulation is stated, the average twitter sentiment drastically decrease. For instance, the average twitter sentiment in Colorado has been from -1.155 to more 
than -1.18. An important decrease of the sentiment expressed on twitter can also be seen in the state of Utah. However, it is not possible to establish a real 
correlation between the regulations and the sentiment felt and expressed on twitter because out of the 8 regulations implemented in April, 4 generated a decrease 
in sentiment and 4 an increase. The link between those two factors is therefore unclear.
 
We can see that the curves between the two states put side by side are generally similar despite some nuances. 
We notice that the two states are close, the state of Utah turns between -0.09 and -0.25, while for Colorado which varies between -0.12 and -0.2. 
The standard deviation of Utah is greater than 0.16 against 0.8 for Colorado. 
This important difference shows how the political party of a state can be a factor on the difference of reaction and feeling expressed on twitter. 
As the P values are above 0.05, we can state that there is a correlation between both datas. The political party is linked to 

Analysing Hexbin’s visualisation of Colorado and Utah enables to see the strength of the sentiment expressed in the tweets. 
In the graph, the more the hexagon is high, the more the sentiment expressed defines a high emotion throughout the month of april. 
When comparing both states, it is clear that Utah’s resident demonstrate some strongest emotions, reaching a magnitude 25 in negative emotions and with a high 
number of tweet counts. Colorado’s state expresses important emotions but they remain less high, reaching a maximum of 20 only once. These two graphs show an 
important difference between the two states in the way they express their emotions about the covid. This proves that the political party can have an impact, a 
critical part of the Republican voters havenotbeen taking the covid pandemic since the beginning of the spread and have acted less responsibly, this is illustrated 
in these graphs, where we can see stronger emotions, and more tweets on the subject.
