This graph represents the average US twitter sentiment on Covid-19 in April 2020. 
Here, no surprises: we can see that, overall, the average sentiment on Covid-19 is negative, as the graph varies between -0.136 and -0.174, two negative numbers. 
Regarding the evolution of the average sentiment, we can see a clear improvement from the 1st to the 10th. Indeed, the average sentiment reaches his peak around the 10th, before a strong decrease. 
From the 12th, the average sentiment starts to stabilize itself around -0.165, although it varies between -0.152 and -0.174, showing a certain instability in the degree of negativity. 
Overall, the average sentiment slightly gets worst with time. 
Main take-away from that graph: the average sentiment on Covid-19 is, of course, negative; therefore we will be working on the degree of negavity of sentiments.

Regarding the number of new deaths and cases per day, it is really hard to see a clear trend. 
The number of new cases is pretty unstable, even if we can see a clear increase from the 20th to the 25th. 
Overall, the number of cases and the number of deaths both increase within the month of April. The number of new deaths is, logically, way smaller than the number of cases, as most of Covid-19 patient recovered from the disease. 
Main take-away from that graph: both the number of deaths and the number of cases increase, we can start to establish a correlation with the average sentiment… 

Now that we have briefly explained the evolution of the average sentiment on Covid-19 tweets and the number of Covid-19 new cases in April 2020, let’s start the verification of our hypothesis. 
We established that there is a negative correlation between the number of new cases and the average sentiment (Parson correlation coefficient of -0.039). 
It means that a larger number of new cases comes with a lower average sentiment. 
This is not a surprising conclusion; the spread of the disease logically comes with an increased unhappiness of the US population. 
But, interestingly, our p-value is way greater than 0.05 (0.839), meaning that there is no causality relation between the number of new cases and the average Covid-19 sentiment. 
Main take-away for that graph: there is no causality relation between the number of new cases and the average sentiment, our hypothesis is partly invalidated.
