This graph represents the average US twitter sentiment on Covid-19 in April 2020. 
Here, no surprises: we can see that, overall, the average sentiment on Covid-19 is negative, as the graph varies between -0.136 and -0.174, two negative numbers. 
Regarding the evolution of the average sentiment, we can see a clear improvement from the 1st to the 10th. Indeed, the average sentiment reaches his peak around the 10th, before a strong decrease. 
From the 12th, the average sentiment starts to stabilize itself around -0.165, although it varies between -0.152 and -0.174, showing a certain instability in the degree of negativity. 
Overall, the average sentiment slightly gets worst with time. 
Main take-away from that graph: the average sentiment on Covid-19 is, of course, negative; therefore we will be working on the degree of negavity of sentiments.

Regarding the number of new deaths and cases per day, it is really hard to see a clear trend. 
The number of new cases is pretty unstable, even if we can see a clear increase from the 20th to the 25th. 
Overall, the number of cases and the number of deaths both increase within the month of April. The number of new deaths is, logically, way smaller than the number of cases, as most of Covid-19 patient recovered from the disease. 
Main take-away from that graph: both the number of deaths and the number of cases increase, we can start to establish a correlation with the average sentiment… 

Now that we have briefly explained the evolution of the average sentiment on Covid-19 tweets and the number of Covid-19 new cases in April 2020, let’s start the verification of our hypothesis. 
We established that there is a negative correlation between the number of new cases and the average sentiment (Parson correlation coefficient of -0.039). 
It means that a larger number of new cases comes with a lower average sentiment. 
This is not a surprising conclusion; the spread of the disease logically comes with an increased unhappiness of the US population. 
But, interestingly, our p-value is way greater than 0.05 (0.839), meaning that there is no causality relation between the number of new cases and the average Covid-19 sentiment. 
Main take-away for that graph: there is no causality relation between the number of new cases and the average sentiment, our hypothesis is partly invalidated.  

Now, let’s compare the changes in daily new Covid-19 deaths with the average sentiment.
The correlation is, one more time, negative: a larger number of deaths comes with a worst average sentiment. However, here, the Pearson correlation number is almost 10 time stronger (-0.360 vs. -0.039) than the one of the new cases / average sentiment, indicating a stronger negative correlation. It means that a change in one of the two variables comes with a stronger opposite change in the other variable. 
Furthermore, regarding this relation, there is a causality link. It means that a change in one of the variables causes a change in the other. We know that because our P-value equals 0.05 which is the minimum number for a causality link. 
Now, we must establish the direction of this causality. What comes first? A change in the average sentiment or a change in the number of deaths? In order to answer that question, we just have to look at the graph as the answer is visual. 
Again, the result is not surprising. Changes in the number of deaths come first. It means that Covid-19 deaths clearly influence the overall tweet sentiment. 
Main take-away from that graph: This result clearly has some great implication and partly (if not fully) validates our hypothesis: there is a relationship between the severity of Covid-19 and the average twitter sentiment!
