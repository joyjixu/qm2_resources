Project Title 
What can Twitter activity, measured by sentiment analysis of COVID19 tweets, tell us about the perception of the pandemic across states in the USA?
What can the sentiment analysis of tweets relating to covid-19 tell us about the perception of the pandemic across states in the USA?

Is there a relationship between this Twitter perception and the introduction of government regulations of varying severity? Is there also a relationship between this Twitter perception and the reality of the pandemic, as measured by the number of cases?

Proposal
We have seen in recent years how the democratisation of digital technologies and growing use of social media as a news outlet has led to the spread of misinformation and the intensification of many issues of public debate, often affecting real-life behavioural responses. 
Sandman's hazard/outrage model reveals how the method and channel of communication of public health risks can affect risk perception by the public. Perceived risk is influenced by two components: hazard and outrage. We will look at how the sentiment (representing ‘outrage’- although in this case the sentiment can be positive, negative, or neutral) of tweets across states in the USA correlates with the actual number of COVID-19 deaths and cases (representing the true hazard). We talk a lot about how social media can ‘stir up hype’ when none exists, while neglecting very real events that don’t make it into the online conversation. Analysis will reveal whether there is a proportionate correlation between our perception of an event and its intensification in reality, highlighting any disproportionate effects social media may have on public event perception.
A successful project will also reveal how the public reacts to regulations imposed by the government in states across the USA. This could prove useful for policymakers to determine how the type/severity of restrictions influences people’s perceptions of the pandemic. It may also reveal whether governments and policymakers tend to react more to real COVID-19 cases or to public outcry. 

Datasets
We will be using an API for Twitter to pull data about Tweets relating to Covid-19
Map of US with data: https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/regional-deaths

Data analysis + presentation
We will use sentiment analysis to assess attitudes to Covid-19 in different US states. We are using state boundaries in order to compare this with the nature, severity, and timing of pandemic restrictions, which were enacted at different times and to differing degrees of severity according to state leadership decisions. We hope to show the progression of these restrictions using a sliding scale.
As we are striving for accuracy and will be pulling thousands of tweets from the API, we have chosen one month- April 2020- from which to compare data about these three factors.
We will do Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) of cases, tweets and government regulations
We will use geospatial analysis to compare and present these 3 factors.
