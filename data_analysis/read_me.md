Initial graphs generated using the matplotlib library

### get_tweet_sentiment.ipynb
Notebook for Sentiment Analysis with Google Cloud Natural Language API

### nlp_samples.csv
Contains 200 tweets with the respective sentiment score from three libraries: textblob, NLTK, and Google

### nlp_samples_labeled.csv
We have conducted our own study of 200 tweets to understand which notebook is best to use for sentiment analysis and the justification of our choice. We added a 'researcher label' with the researchers subjective opinion of the sentiment of the tweet. This was then compared to the sentiment scores given by the three notebooks (textblob, NLTK, and Google) to see which notebook provided a sentiment score most similar to the researcher label.

### sentiment_analysis_notes_and_limitations.md
Initial research of limitations of the libraries and sentiment analysis approaches in data analysis. This will be added to our methodology and literature reviews.
