# Case studies
* using select_states.ipynb, we randomly selected one strongly democrat state and one strongly republican state, in order to determine if political views played a role in the relationship between twitter sentiment and covid deaths
* the selected states were Utah (Republican) and Colorado (Democrat)
* hexbins.ipynb contains the code to create hexbins on daily sentiment and magnitude for each state as well as an animated gif over the month of April
